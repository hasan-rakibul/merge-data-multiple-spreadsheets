# merge-data-multiple-spreadsheets

It is prepared to help process the final-year design project evaluation data from several spreadsheets.

At the [Electrical and Electronic Engineering department of BRAC University](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/academics/departments/electrical-and-electronic-engineering), project supervisors (ATC) evaluate their group of students into several criteria (CO). The evaluation spreadsheet, therefore, consists of the numerical and string evaluation records in all different categories.

A specific portion of rows and columns are extracted from each worksheet of all spreadsheets (workbooks), and all these extracted data are merged and saved in a new spreadsheet.

For obvious reasons, the raw evaluation spreadsheets and the output spreadsheet (merged) are not made public.
